# Multi-intron splicing order

This repository contains the scripts necessary to compute multi-intron splicing order from nanopore sequencing data, as performed in the manuscripts "Pre-mRNA splicing order is predetermined and maintains splicing fidelity across multi-intronic transcripts" (Choquet et al. Nat Struct Mol Biol 2023) and "Genetic regulation of nascent RNA maturation revealed by direct RNA nanopore sequencing" (Choquet et al. Genome Res 2024)
